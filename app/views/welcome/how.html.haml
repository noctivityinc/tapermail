      %h2 The Flow

      %ol
        %li People send you email.  They just won't stop
        %li This email, right now, goes into the "cloud" where it waits for you to view it online, on your phone or your computer
        %li Taper securely monitors your server
        %li When it sees new email, it moves up to <strong>five emails</strong> into your inbox for you to deal with.  Our extensive research shows that five is a small number, which makes it easy to manage.
        %li All other emails are moved to a new <code>@TaperQueue</code> folder/label in your account.  If you really can't wait for something to move to your inbox, you can view it in the queue folder.

      %h2 Clearing A Spot

      %p.lead
        With only five emails to deal with at a time, you'll honestly be amazed at how 
        quickly you can deal with email.  Once you delete, file (label) or flag (star) an 
        email to get it out of your inbox, Taper lets the next email through.

      %h2 Missing Important Emails

      %p
        Everyone who hears about Taper, literally everyone, thinks this before actually trying it:
        %blockquote 
          %em This won't work for me.  I'll miss too many important emails

      %p
        How can we put this delicately - you're wrong.  There are three reasons why:

        %ol
          %li Since Taper makes you delete, file or flag for follow-up on an email before letting you see the next one, you learn how to process your email extremely quickly without even realizing you're doing it.
          %li We cheat.  Taper moves all newsletters and mass emails to the end of the queue so you receive everything else first before receiving the less important stuff.
          %li If you have messages in your queue for more than five minutes, we send you a single summary email letting you know what's waiting for you.  Need it now, just view it in the queue folder.
